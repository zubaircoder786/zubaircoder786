Hi, I’m Muhammad Zubair.

I’ve been a web developer for three years, and it’s always been my dream to work in this field. I am passionate about creating beautiful websites that are easy to use and understand.

After graduating from university, I immediately started working on my projects and learning as much as possible. My goal is to create intuitive, user-friendly, and functional websites.

My strengths include:

– Using HTML5/CSS3/JS in combination with AJAX/AJAX+JS to create dynamic websites with ease

– Creating beautiful designs using the latest technologies available (SASS, SCSS)
